# General Description:
The uploaded files follow the progress I've made to complete a year-long (still-in-development) project offered from the IEEE student branch at UCLA titled Pocket Racers. The end goal of the project is to build an autonomous small car that will be to traverse a track and also compete with other autonomous cars. Throughout the year, several labs will be completed in order to acquire the necessary skills and knowledge in order to assemble a functioning car.
